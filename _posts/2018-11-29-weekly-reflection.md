Hi it's me Jalen.We took  a midtern like on Monday. We are supposed to pick a question and write about it. I choose question 5 which is (56/(2*4)) + (3- -7). The answer is  17. This question is m1 one because it uses funtions like "-" and "+". It it also a eva;utaion expression because they normally look like that.
