Hi It's me Jalen again.This week has been really stressful. In our ap cs class we been trying to make any type of flag on pyret.I had trouble trying to combine shapes to make my flag. I'm making the Ireland flag which I found to be the easy one to make. I was able to make the flag but I found it really hard to combine shapes and that's really it once I found out how to it was easy
