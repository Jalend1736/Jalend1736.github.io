Sooooooo I missed last week reflections.I really need this because progess reports are coming up. This week we been learning about data tables. We looked at a data table with a whole bunch of animals names and info about them.Then we looked at a spreadsheet with the animals. Than we look at a code containing the info for the spreadsheet.That's really all I know about it so far see you guys later :).
